## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic File Operations
```python
from modules.module_1_main import WorkspaceManager
workspace_manager = WorkspaceManager()
result = await workspace_manager.write_file("test.txt", "Hello, World!")
```

### Cost Tracking
```python
from modules.module_3_economy import CostTracker
cost_tracker = CostTracker()
await cost_tracker.record_token_usage(
    operation_id="test_op",
    model="gpt-4",
    input_tokens=100,
    output_tokens=50,
    operation_type="test"
)
```

### Memory Management
```python
from modules.module_2_support import MemoryManager
memory_manager = MemoryManager()
await memory_manager.start()
await memory_manager.set_cache("key", "value", ttl_seconds=3600)
```

## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Integration Test**: Some enum and data structure issues (doesn't affect core functionality)
2. **Budget Manager**: Minor string value attribute error (cost tracking still works)
3. **Cache Stats Display**: Minor formatting issue (cache operations work)
4. **PostgreSQL**: asyncpg import issue (not required for core functionality)

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Fix Integration Tests**: Resolve remaining test issues
2. **Enhance Error Messages**: Improve user feedback
3. **Add More Tests**: Expand test coverage

### Future Enhancements
1. **Database Integration**: Full PostgreSQL setup
2. **Web Interface**: Dashboard for monitoring
3. **API Endpoints**: REST API for external access
4. **Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes configs
